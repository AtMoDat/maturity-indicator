You will be asked questions related to the principles underpinning Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). Once you have answered all the questions in each section you will be given a \"green bar\" indicator based on your answers in that section, and when all sections are completed, an overall \"FAIRness\" indicator is provided.",
